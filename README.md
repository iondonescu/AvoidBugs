Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

The game starts by opening index.html file in your browser or accessing this link :

In this game you play the role of a shipwrecked who has reached the shore. There is one more step to be safe. You must avoid all the ugly and giant  insects that invaded the beach.
To reach safe ground you must avoid the bugs.
To do so , as a player, use the arrow keys on your keyboard:
Pressing Left arrow (guess what?), you are moving one step left.
Pressing Right arrow, (you know?) you are moving one step right (right?!).
Pressing Up arrow (you will never guess!), you are moving one step forwards.
And finally, pressing Down arrow you are moving backwards.
If you are to close to a bug, you lose strength and you get back in the water to take a break. Your strength decrease by one heart.
You must reach the safe ground within three attempts. If not, consider yourself an unlucky angel and you lose the game.
